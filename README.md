# Landing Page Project üñ•Ô∏è
This the second "The Odin Project" exercise.

It improved the knowledge of HTML and CSS, which are essentials.

The most important thing applied here, is the Flexbox, a tool to work around with containers and elements of a page.

It was really nice to code, and when things just "clicked" it felt like a relief.

This is a preview of the page:

It shows a landing page of a business that I had to "invent". In my case, I chose a jewelry store, and displayed photos of rings, and earrings, along with sign-up buttons, and copyright on the footer of the page.

This is the link to the live page:
