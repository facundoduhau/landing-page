# Landing Page Project
This is a The Odin Project Landing Page, where I work with CSS Flexbox, along with free to use images
The use of Flexbox, in CSS, is the key to setting up all the divs distributions in this project
Luckily, along with the knowledge of The Odin Project, and Google/Stack Overflow, every knowledge wall I crushed onto, was able to be crossed over
